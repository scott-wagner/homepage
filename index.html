    <h1>FortNite: Save The World</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am going to teach you about Fortnite Save The World! It is very fun! The first thing you should know about forntie save the world is that 98% of the worlds population has<b>VANISHED!</b> and zombies have averred (called husk's) and my theory is that they turned into the husk's! It is up to you and the remaining 2% of the world to make babies! Not seriously though you have to shot the monsters with... you gassed is cocked and loaded <b> GUNS!</b> and swords and grenades and hammers etc. etc. </p>
