    <h1>FortNite: Save The World</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am going to teach you about Fortnite Save The World! It is very fun! The first thing you should know about forntie save the world is that 98% of the worlds population has<b>VANISHED!</b> and zombies have averred (called husk's) and my theory is that they turned into the husk's! It is up to you and the remaining 2% of the world to make babies! Not seriously though you have to shot the monsters with... you gassed is cocked and loaded <b> GUNS!</b> and swords and grenades and hammers etc. etc. </p>
    <p>The game starts with a cut scene it tells you the 98% of the people vanished etc. you run up to a place with a robot he I mean <em>she</em> thinks it is a drill you tell her it's not she tells you they were to prevent it from happening someone calls they tell you something you put on a head set and sort of control the caller? Battle some husk's learn the basics then you run up and save some people set some traps launch a <strong>ROCKET</strong> (seriously!) run out battle more husk's win go to the menu get some v-bucks and llama piÃ±atas hit them brake them get loot learn how to go to places and then get missions and do that for the rest of the game!</p>
    <p>Now that you know what happens it is time you know what you are up against!first thing you should know is that their is two types of enamies: husks,and mist monsters first we will be doing husks!</p><ul>
  <li> Husk
       The "standard", most common type of husk that the player encounters. They utilize a melee attack using their hands, but deal relatively low damage per hit and have relatively low health. They are individually quite weak and only pose a threat in larger groups.</li>

      <li> Husky
       Beefier than the standard Husk, they deal moderate damage to players and buildings. They can soak up quite a bit of damage and can take down buildings if left alone for too long.</li>
          <li>   Lobber
   Lobbers are the only female husk. They throw purple or orange flaming skulls from a long distance. Purple skulls deal damage on impact to players and structures, while orange skulls linger and deal damage per second to players only.</li><li>Pitcher
    Pitchers carry a baseball helmet full of bones, which they throw at the player. They have a slow wind-up that makes their projectiles relatively easy to dodge. They tend not to focus on the objective but instead focus on distracting and damaging the player.</li>

  <li>  Sploder
       Similar in size and shape to the Husky husk, they wear a red shirt and carry a propane tank on their shoulder. When near players or buildings, they will throw their propane tank to do significant damage to all players, structures, and other husks near it.</li>

      <li>  Beehive
    Beehive husks appear as a standard Husk with a beehive on its head, surrounded by a swarm of bees. Occasionally they will stop and send a targeted swarm of bees at a player. Bees will linger on any tile where the Beehive husk has walked or directed bees towards, dealing damage per second to players within the tile. The beehive can be shot off with a headshot, turning them into a regular Husk.</li>



    <li>  Dwarf
   Dwarf husks are smaller than a standard husk. They primarily hunt players and can jump over one-tile-high walls to reach the player. They deal moderate damage and come in swarms so they can hurt a player quickly, but they are very fragile, taking no more than a hit or two to kill with most weapons.</li>
